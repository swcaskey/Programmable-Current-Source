# Programmable Current Source

An adjustable, precision current source designed for test bench and calibration use.

## Overview
- Generates a stable, programmable current output controlled via voltage or digital interface.
- Demonstrates analog circuit design and control principles.

## Circuit Design
- Op-amp and MOSFET feedback loop regulating output current.
- Output range: 0 – 200 mA.
- Configurable via potentiometer or DAC voltage input.
- Based on Howland current pump topology.

## Validation
- Simulated in LTSpice to confirm linear current regulation.
- Tested on breadboard with oscilloscope and multimeter verification.
- Stable operation across 5 – 15 V supply range.
